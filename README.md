# Imputation Methods for Missing Values in Clinical Data

This repository contains the code and resources for my Master's thesis, which explores and evaluates various imputation techniques for handling missing data in clinical datasets. The study investigates the impact of different imputation methods on downstream tasks such as predictive modeling and data analysis in healthcare.

## Thesis Overview

- **Thesis Title:** Identify optimal Imputation for Missing Data for assessing postprandial Metabolism
- **University:** University of Bern
- **Program:** Bioinformatics and Computational Biology
- **Author:** Marcine bessire

## Objective

The goal of this thesis is to compare different missing data imputation methods and evaluate their effectiveness in real-world clinical data scenarios. This includes both statistical and machine learning-based techniques, with an emphasis on preserving data integrity and improving the performance of predictive models.

## Dataset

- **Dataset Name:** FAO Data, BAS Data, Intact Lipids
- **Missingness:** Naturally occurring / synthetically introduced 

## Imputation Methods

The following imputation methods were implemented and evaluated:
